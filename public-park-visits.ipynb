    "As people are increasingly living in urban areas parks, walkways, accessible forests and natural landscapes become more essential public services<font color='blue'><a href='#[2]'>[2]</a></font>. These areas provide a space for people to escape the pressures of modern life, where they can enjoy natural or semi-natural environments, exercise, play and relax. Such facilities improve the physical and mental health of users and encourage active recreational activities. As the famed American landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmsted said parks are the “lungs of the city.”<font color='blue'><a href='#[2]'>[2]</a></font>.  Parks also serve as wildlife reserves and a place where people can observe wildlife.\n",

    "Proximity to a park or walkway attracts other economic investments to an area improving the attractiveness of an area to both live and work.

    "\n",
    "Large national parks can be spread out over large areas, with difficult terrain and may include numerous entrances making continuous user counts difficult or impossible. Even monitoring visits to medium sized regional parks with fewer entrances can prove challenging. There are are number of methods of collecting park data<font color='blue'><a href='#[1]'>[5]</a></font> such as:\n",
    "- Physical counts at the park\n",
    "- Automated counters\n",
    "- Visitor studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods of counting numbers in park may include counting people leaving the parks at all entrances on random days. Depending on the characteristics of the park, statistical sampling techniques are often used to approximate overall park visits using various count techniques and studies to correlate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a given area, some parks are more attractive to visitors than others. A good method to fully understand how each individual aspect of the park influences the attraction for each park is to assign comparative indexes that gives ratings and weightings to individual park elements such as various activities, amenity and aesthetic features available<font color='blue'><a href='#[5]'>[5]</a></font>. \n",
    "Ratings may be based on the element condition and popularity for each individual amenity, activity, aesthetic feature in each park.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all aspects in a park receive equal use. Each aspect weightings can be based on observers starting in one area of the park and progressively sampling park users and noting what activities they are undertaken at given time period. The time periods are important as different times of day and days of the week attractive different user and activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing the weighted ratings for individual element could determine an **amenity index, activity index, aesthetic rating** for each park. Combined with the **park size**, these indexes can be used to form a comparative characteristics of each park in an area.\n",

    "For this project, I intend to focus on a selection of variables and use simulated data for these variables to build up a basic model of how these affect park visitations. This research in combination with real count data and park characteristics may be used to facilitate further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input factors I have chosen to explore to compare the resultant visits to a park are:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Republic of Ireland current population is approximately 4.9 million<font color='blue'><a href='#[6]'>[6]</a></font> and is evenly divided 50:50 between males and females. The population is divided into 65% working population (aged 15 to 64), 20% youth population (aged 0 to 14) and 15% elderly or retired people. Employment rates of the working population is currently at 70% with an unemployed rate of 5%. Part-time workers account for 20% people employed. Approximately 6% of the working age population are homemakers, which leave approximate 19% of the working population, the majority of which are likely in full or part time education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='blue'>Time factors</font>\n",
    "Day of the week, time of the day and seasons play a major role in park visitations rates. Many parks are only open between dawn and dust which varies from season to season<font color='blue'><a href='#[7]'>[7]</a></font>. During winter these times are even more restricted as daylight hours are reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of people in Ireland have a 39 hour working week between 8.30am and 5pm Monday to Thursday, finish at 4pm on Fridays and with a proportion work four 4 or more hours overtime on Saturday<font color='blue'><a href='#[7]'>[7]</a></font>. These hours generally limit free time that many working people can visits park to early mornings, lunchtime, late evenings and at weekends in particular Sundays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schools generally run from 9am up to 2.30pm or 4pm Monday to Friday<font color='blue'><a href='#[7]'>[7]</a></font>. When combined with family members who are part-time workers, unemployed, homemakers or retired makes evening times after school a good opportunity for park visits. When schools are closed during summer, mid-terms or bank holidays additional time slot are available for park visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='blue'>Weather and temperature</font>\n",
    "Weather is a key factor in park visitation that is difficult to predict in Ireland. Irelands mild temprature climate means that summers are cooler (mean daily temperature of 16 to 18 degrees celcius) and winters are warmer (mean daily temperature of 4 to 7 degrees celcius) than other countries, but the possibility of percipitation is high and oceanic weather fronts can be very variable between sunny and rainy spells <font color='blue'><a href='#[8]'>[8]</a></font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general park visits are lower on wet days. However, even in winter, a dry weekend days can still attract good levels of park visits. A dry summer Sunday or bank holiday Monday generally gives the highest level of park visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='blue'>Simulating park data</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis I have decided to define the following park constraints and assumptions:\n",
    "- Local population within 5km of the park is approximately 40,000\n",
    "- The park includes a playground, walkways and sports fields, which provides attractivenes for all ages\n",
    "- Local weather patterns relate to the south of Ireland\n",
    "- 200 data points will form the data set.\n",
    "- Variables in the data set include inputs of season, rainy_weather and day and resulting output park_visits from the local population.\n",
