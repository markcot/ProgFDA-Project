#### Introduction
This document is my marked down file for the GMIT module 'Programming for Data Analysis' project. The project includes a review of public park  visits, the factors that affect the number of visitors and vairous methods of visit data collection and simulation. The project is undertaken using a jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), which is included in this repository as 'public-park-visits.ipynb'. The jupyter notebook uses the Python programming language (https://www.python.org/) to simulate a sample of basis park visitation variables spread out over a year resulting in a sample of simulatated daily park visit numbers.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed on the jupyter notebook viewer https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markcot/ProgFDA-Project/blob/master/public-park-visits.ipynb?flush_cache=true.

The GitHub repository  can be cloned to a local hard drive and run locally using jupyter notebook from the command line or terminal. When the notebook is first opened, the user should start by running all of code in the notebook. Select from the drop down option 'Restart & Run All' under the menu heading 'Kernel'.

#### Project Plan

- Review need for parks
- Identify variables that affect park visits
- Review methods of measuring and estimating public park visit
- Investigate distribution of proposed project variables
- Simulate a sample of data points for the selected project variables
- Present basis review of simulated data set
